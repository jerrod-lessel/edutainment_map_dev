            "choices": [
              "It doesn’t — dry rivers are basically decorative trenches.",
              "It shapes flooding, groundwater recharge, habitats, and where people build infrastructure.",
              "It only matters for fishing year-round.",
              "It exists mainly to confuse map readers."

            "correct": 1,
            "explain": "Even when it looks dry, the river corridor shapes flooding, recharges groundwater, supports habitats, and influences where roads and cities can safely exist."

            "question": "Why is the Santa Maria River often dry on the surface for much of the year?",
            "choices": [
              "Because California doesn’t get any rain.",
              "Because the channel sediments can soak up water, and most rainfall is seasonal.",
              "Because the river is artificially turned off each summer.",
              "Because rivers only flow during leap years."
            ],
            "correct": 1,
            "explain": "In a Mediterranean climate, rain is concentrated in winter. Much of the flow can also infiltrate into sandy/gravelly river sediments, so surface water disappears while subsurface flow and groundwater remain important."

            "choices": [
              "Flooding that can overwhelm channels, bridges, and roads during big storms.",
              "Spontaneous geysers appearing under the downtown streets.",
              "The river slowly turning into lava (rare, but dramatic).",
              "The water becoming too polite to cross a bridge."
            ],
            "correct": 0,
            "explain": "Flooding is the major risk: intense storms can rapidly increase discharge, forcing engineers to design bridges/culverts and plan development around floodplains and extreme events."
